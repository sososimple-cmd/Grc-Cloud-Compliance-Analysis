# 🌩️ Cloud Compliance Gap Analysis: AWS + NIST CSF 
_By Sophia Mitchell_

---

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-world **Cloud Compliance Gap Analysis** using **AWS** as the cloud platform and the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as the guiding standard.

The goal: Identify common compliance gaps and propose actionable remediation in an AWS environment—focusing on **IAM**, **logging**, and **data classification**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

✅ Assess a cloud environment’s compliance posture 
✅ Map AWS security controls to NIST CSF 
✅ Identify and document compliance gaps 
✅ Recommend technical and policy-based remediation 
✅ Present findings in business-friendly formats

## 🔍 Summary of Gaps

| Control Area | Gap | Risk | NIST Ref | Fix |
|--------------|-----|------|----------|-----|
| IAM | MFA not enforced | High | PR.AC-7 | Enable MFA for all users |
| Logging | No centralized CloudTrail logging | High | DE.CM-1 | Activate logging + alerts |
| S3 | No classification or tagging | Medium | ID.GV-3 | Create classification policy |

## 💡 Insights

 “MFA isn’t optional—compliance depends on it.” 
 This project taught me how **small oversights create massive risk** and how to connect technical issues with business impact.
